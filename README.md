# Programming as a business user in an enterprise environment

Notes from a talk given in 2016 at Sydney's ModelOff Global Training Camp.

Central theme: how can you automate tasks if you have a Windows machine, Microsoft Office and VBA, but can't:

- download any programs that aren't included with Windows, or
- create new programs by compiling source code?

Discussion of .NET, and PowerShell in particular, was omitted due to time constraints.

Files in this repository starting with 'U' are intended to be generic code that can be called upon when necessary.

## High-Level Excel

Designing models to facilitate automation.

- Location references ('cell A4:B8', etc) introduce irrelevant information into your formulas that can potentially be a source of errors
- Structured references can be a clearer way to express what you mean, and are potentially more resilient to changes in your spreadsheets
- Named ranges are useful when you know exactly how many cells will be needed, such as a TRUE/FALSE setting, or the four suits in a deck of cards
- Excel tables (known as ListObjects in VBA) are useful when you don't know how much data you'll need to store (that is, it can be resized to zero or more rows)
- Excel tables are also useful for separating inputs and calculations: you can set up a table so that all of its columns are calculated columns, and expand it to the size you need (see the file U_ListObject.bas)
- Be aware of how to manage errors using VBA code (particularly if you intend on fully automating a process).

## Extending VBA

How to talk to other applications.

- You can use VBA to send information between programs, including triggering actions (such as telling Outlook to create an email using information stored in a worksheet)
- This uses the 'Component Object Model' (**COM**), which is basically a way for programs to expose information about how other programs can talk to them (**type libraries**)
- You can explore type libraries using Excel's Object Browser (press F2 in Excel's VBA editor)
- You can also use COM to add extra functions to VBA (such as **regular expressions**, a powerful way to extract subsets of text based on whether it matches a pattern you specify - see U_RegExp.bas).

## Beyond VBA

How to overcome VBAâ€™s limitations.

- Windows' Command Prompt provides access to some simple programs which automate tasks of finding text in files (**FINDSTR**) and comparing two files based on their text contents or binary representation (**FC**)
- You can use Command Prompt by opening it and typing one-off instructions, or alternatively, write those instructions in a file ending in '.bat' so they can be reused (a **batch file**)
- As a more powerful alternative to the Command Prompt, Windows Script Host can be used to code your machine using languages very similar to VBA (**VBScript**) and JavaScript (**JScript**) - you can use them to script Excel and trigger VBA macros, and you can carry across your COM knowledge from 'Extending VBA'
- Windows' Task Scheduler can be used to schedule execution of programs or scripts, including batch files and VBScript/Jscript files (using **cscript**).

JScript has potential:

- it's more powerful than VBA or VBScript (you can use functions as inputs to other functions - see U_GlobalsMgmt.js)
- it can be called from within VBA using ScriptControl (see example_sort_array_with_JScript.bas)
- JavaScript has a very active and open community
- it can be a basis on which to build other languages (such as TypeScript) - all the language needs is a compiler written in JavaScript
- it can be extended easily by downloading scripts as plain text (see example_handlebars_templating.js and example_google_closure_integration.js)
- it is highly resilient (all you really need is a web browser)
- it potentially offers a migration path if you ever want to move an Excel workbook's functions to the web.
